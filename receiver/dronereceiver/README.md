The Drone Receiver generates metrics, traces, and logs from the Drone CI/CD system.

For a list of generated metrics, see the [generated metrics documentation](./documentation.md).

## Configuration

> [!TIP]  
> The following configuration should work OOTB with the Docker compose file provided.

```yaml
receivers:
  dronereceiver:
    collection_interval: 1m
    path: /drone/webhook
    endpoint: localhost:3333
    secret: bea26a2221fd8090ea38720fc445eca6
    drone:
      token: <DRONE_TOKEN>
      host: http://localhost:8080
      database:
        host: localhost
        db: drone
        username: postgres
        password: postgres
    repos:
      org1/repo1:
        - main
      org1/repo2:
        - main
        - development
      org2/another-repo:
        - main
        - v1.0.x
```

## Local Drone instance

It is possible to use a local Drone instance for easier development.

### Environment variables

The `docker-compose.yml` file expects the following environment variables to be set:

```properties
DRONE_SERVER_PROXY_HOST=
DRONE_GITHUB_CLIENT_ID=
DRONE_GITHUB_CLIENT_SECRET=
GH_HANDLE=
```

you can copy the example env vars file and follow the instructions below to fill them in:

```bash
cp .env.example .env
```

### Tunneling

> [!TIP]  
> These instructions use [ngrok](https://ngrok.com/download), but feel free to use any other
> tunneling service and adapt the instructions accordingly.

First, [install ngrok](https://ngrok.com/download) to expose a tunnel to your local drone instance.

Once installed, start ngrok with:

```bash
ngrok http 8080
```

the output should look something like this:

```bash
Session Status                online
Account                       you@example.com
Version                       3.3.1
Region                        Europe (eu)
Latency                       44ms
Web Interface                 http://127.0.0.1:4040
Forwarding                    https://SOMETHING.ngrok-free.app -> http://localhost:8080
```

Copy the forwarding url (in this case `https://SOMETHING.ngrok-free.app`) and use it to configure the `DRONE_SERVER_PROXY_HOST` environment variable in the `.env` file.

> [!NOTE]  
> By default no webhook events are sent to the receiver from GitHub (i.e. when
> pushing to a branch to trigger a build), so make sure your pipelines can be run manually.
>
> If you want to automatically trigger pipelines in your local Drone instance, you need to add a
> webhook to your repository configuration in **Settings -> Webhooks**.
> The Payload URL should be `https://SOMETHING.ngrok-free.app/hook`. You can find the webhook secret
> in the [compose file](./docker-compose.drone.yml under the `DRONE_WEBHOOK_SECRET` environment
> variable. Select `application/json` as the content type and the following events:
>
> - Branch or tag creation
> - Branch or tag deletion
> - Deployments
> - Pull requests
> - Pushes

### GitHub OAuth App

We then need to create a GitHub OAuth App to use for authentication with Drone.
In Github, Go to **Settings -> Developer settings -> OAuth Apps** and click on "New OAuth App".

Pick whatever you want for the name and description, and use the ngrok forwarding url for the `Homepage URL` and `Authorization callback URL` fields as follows (example using the URL from above):

```
Homepage URL:
https://SOMETHING.ngrok-free.app


Authorization callback URL:
https://SOMETHING.ngrok-free.app/login
```

Click on "Register application".

After the application is registered, generate a `Client secret`.

Take note of the `Client ID` and `Client secret` values and use them to configure the `DRONE_GITHUB_CLIENT_ID` and `DRONE_GITHUB_CLIENT_SECRET` environment variables in the `.env` file.

### Run Drone

You can now start Drone with:

```bash
docker compose up -d
```

And use the ngrok forwarding url to access the Drone UI.
Navigate to the repository you want to start monitoring and click on "Activate repository".

> [!NOTE]  
> This also starts Tempo, Loki and Prometheus from the `docker-compose.yml` file in the root of the repository. If you only want to start Drone you can use
>
> ```bash
> docker compose up -f docker-compose.drone.yml -d
> ```

### Get your drone token

If you filled in the `GH_HANDLE` environment variable in the `.env` file, your user has admin privileges. You can get your Drone token by navigating to https://SOMETHING.ngrok-free.app/account (replace the url with your ngrok forwarding url) and copy the token.

### Configure the collector

Update the `dronereceiver` receiver in the `config.yaml` file to use the [Drone token](#get-your-drone-token) from above:

```yaml
receivers:
  dronereceiver:
    collection_interval: 15s
    endpoint: localhost:3333
    path: /drone/webhook
    secret: bea26a2221fd8090ea38720fc445eca6
    drone:
      token: <YOUR TOKEN>
      host: http://${NETWORK_HOST}:8080
```
