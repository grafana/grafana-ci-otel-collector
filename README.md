## Configuration

The collector is configured using the `config.yaml` file in the root of the repository.
You can learn more about the OpenTelemetry Collector configuration [here][otel-configuration].

Refer to each component's documentation (linked above) for specific configuration options.

A barebones configuration file can be found in the `config.example.yaml` file in the root of the repository, with preconfigured exporters for Loki, Tempo, and Prometheus. You can use this file as a starting point for your own configuration.

[otel-configuration]: https://opentelemetry.io/docs/collector/configuration/

## Running Tempo, Loki, and Prometheus

[A basic Docker compose file](./docker-compose.yml) is provided in the root of the repository to run Tempo, Loki, and Prometheus.

To start the services, run:

```bash
docker compose up
```
